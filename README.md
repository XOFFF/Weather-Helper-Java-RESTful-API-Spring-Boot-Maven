# Weather-Helper-Java-RESTful-API-Spring-Boot-Maven
Program is used by me to get 5 days data forecast for the specific location using AccuWeather api.
To use it choose what type of location data you want to write down after the launch, and then write your city Name (1) or POSTCODE (2).
There are only 50 free requests per day. You can use my apiKey to use the program, or you can create your own account on the https://developer.accuweather.com and have your own free 50 requests per day.
Check it out and let me know if something wrong or something I can add. Enjoy :)
